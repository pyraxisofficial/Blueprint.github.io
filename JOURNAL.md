## 10/25/2025 - Made A Braille Controller Design  

Everything has a Beginning, Here is Mine
I made controller design, in blender. This controller has extra buttons, that have vibrators in them, which make it so that, you can receive input and give output.

## 10/26/2025 4:04 PM - Routed The PCB  

Routed The PCB to the buttons and the ESP32, it took some time, but got it woking. this was done in EasyEDA. Now time to turn this vision into a reality.

## 10/26/2025 4:07 PM - Making An Alternative Keyboard Design  

Just Like the Braille Controller, this is also using haptics. it gives output in the form of vibrations, in the same keys used to give input. There are **custom programmable buttons** coming along with this. With An App to control those.

## 11/2/2025 7 PM - Re-Routed The PCB  

The other version was a little wonky, and had a few problems, so finally i rerouted the PCB,
This one has **8 buttons**, **4 Programmable buttons** and **2 ESP32**'s

## 11/2/2025 9 PM - Sample Prototype  

Made A Sample but working prototype for the braille keyboard. it uses the ESP32, took lots of time for the soldering. there are only 6 buttons for entering, but the vibrations work. you can receive output.

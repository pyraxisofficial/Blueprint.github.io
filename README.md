# Braille Controller & Keyboard Combo

## Overview
The **Braille Controller & Keyboard Combo** is a project designed to make everyday computer use—including web browsing and routine digital tasks—much easier and more accessible for everyone, especially for people with disabilities.Our device empowers users who are blind, visually impaired, or differently abled to interact effortlessly with modern computers.

## Why We Made This
We began this project at the school level for presentation at a tech expo, inspired by a desire to make technology inclusive and genuinely helpful for all users, regardless of ability. Our goal was to bridge digital divides and empower individuals with accessible, affordable tech.

## Hardware Components
- **ESP32**: Microcontroller for main logic and Bluetooth/wireless communication
- **Buttons**: Interface for input, navigation, and Braille coding
- **Vibrators**: Haptic feedback to communicate information by touch
- **Micro-USB Cable**: Power and wired data connection
- **Custom Circuit Board**: Houses all the components and wiring

## Features
- **Braille character input** for text entry and navigation
- **Haptic feedback** for confirmations, notifications, and interface cues
- **Ergonomic design** for comfortable one-handed or two-handed use
- **Easy integration** with computers and supported web browsers (Our Own Browser - Pyraxis) [Download](https://pyraxis.rf.gd)

## Getting Started
1. **Assemble** the components as described in the wiring diagram.
2. **Connect** the ESP32 to your computer via USB or power it as needed.
3. **Use** buttons for input—the device supports standard Braille encoding.
4. **Feel** immediate haptic feedback for every interaction.

## Project Status
- **Prototype**: Our initial prototypes have been built and presented at local tech expos and continue to evolve based on user feedback.
